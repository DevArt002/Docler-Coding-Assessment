# How it works

-   You can input messages in input field and click send button. If the message is a link and it is idicating a image, it renders the image on message view.
-   When you click settings button on the header, you will see settings modal. There you can change username, clock type and shortcut availability. Also, you can restore the default settings.
-   All settings factors are on localstorage. It means, when you reload page, the settings are obtained.
-   By adusting shortcut availability, you can send message using Ctrl+Enter or not.
-   By adjusting clock type, you can see message time as 12 hours or 24 hours.
